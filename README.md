# srs-dvh

[![Tests](https://github.com/Kiragroh/srs-dvh/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kiragroh/srs-dvh/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

**A 3D DVH builder for high-definition, HDSS-like structures**, with particular
attention to small SRS targets. Integrate the full supplied body in physical
coordinates, independently of CT slice spacing and dose-grid spacing.

**Why this matters:** a changed DVH can reflect a changed structure or evaluation
method even when the supplied dose field is unchanged. Replanning on changed
structures can additionally change the dose field. These are different effects.

![Actual benchmark: initial disagreement, HDSS source preservation, and remaining native-reference difference](docs/hdss_forward_validation.png)

*Twelve consecutive synthetic targets from the research benchmark. Left: the
initial stored-native versus regular-dose-export disagreement. Middle: the
original binary source and the independently recovered HDSS body give the same
full-3D readout on the same fine dose. Right: their difference from the stored
native histogram remains visible.*

**Forward source preservation is demonstrated; native TPS equivalence is not
yet established.** The forward test recovered all 120 source voxel bodies and
checked 120 DVHs: 72 planning targets and 48 GTV readouts in the PTV plans.
The largest source-versus-HDSS dose-metric
difference was below 0.0001 Gy at 0.05-mm integration. This checks preservation of
the specified binary volume, not identity with a proprietary reconstructed
surface or native histogram. [Evidence and scope](docs/forward_validation.md).

## Install and run

Python 3.10 or newer. Clone the repository and install locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kiragroh/srs-dvh.git
cd srs-dvh
python -m pip install -e ".[contours,dev,examples]"
python examples/quickstart.py
python -m pytest tests -q
```

The package is distributed through this repository; these instructions do not
assume a PyPI release. NumPy and SciPy are the core dependencies. Shapely is
needed for the polygon adapter; Matplotlib only for the example figure.

## Use with your own arrays

```python
from srs_dvh import DoseGrid, VoxelROI, converge

# Arrays and affines must already describe the same physical coordinate frame.
dose = DoseGrid(dose_array_Gy, dose_index_to_world_affine)
roi = VoxelROI(binary_mask, roi_index_to_world_affine)
dvh, evidence = converge(roi, dose)

if not evidence["converged"]:
    raise RuntimeError("Integration has not met the refinement criteria")

print(dvh.metrics())
volume_percent = dvh.volume_at_dose([15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28])
```

Coordinates are in **mm**, dose in **Gy**, volume weights in **mm³**. Each affine
maps array-index **voxel centres** to physical coordinates. There is no assumed
array-axis order: the affine columns define it. Verify registration first. No
shift, dose scaling or threshold is fitted to a reference TPS curve.

## Supported geometry

| Input | Evaluated volume |
|---|---|
| `VoxelROI` | Complete occupied binary voxels, including the outer half-voxel extent |
| `ImplicitROI` | A mathematical body specified by a physical-space predicate and bounding box |
| `PolygonSlabROI` | Polygons with holes and explicit slab intervals on parallel, possibly oblique planes |
| Custom adapter | `quadrature(step_mm)` yielding physical points and positive volume weights |

High-definition source planes can be evaluated in their own basis without first
sampling them onto CT slices. The [oblique-contour example](examples/oblique_contours.py)
shows this interface. For DICOM RTSTRUCT or HDSS files, a separate reader must
supply the correct source planes, physical frame and geometric reconstruction.
This release is a numerical DVH builder, not a DICOM importer or HDSS file writer.

`PolygonSlabROI` integrates an **explicit polygon-prism model** using exact clipped
areas. It does not guess missing contours or a TPS-specific interpolation between
planes. See the [methods and input contract](docs/methods.md).

## Accuracy and examples

The repository contains **18 tests** covering known spherical DVHs, oblique and
anisotropic coordinates, unequal volume weights, holes, tiny contour caps,
out-of-grid rejection and refinement checks.

The [analytical benchmark](examples/analytical_benchmark.py) uses four
sphere/ellipsoid configurations. At 0.025-mm integration spacing, its largest
absolute D98 error against the exact continuous-dose result is **0.0012 Gy**.
The largest curve error on the benchmark's stated plotting thresholds is
**0.157 percentage points**. These are results for those test fields, not a
universal accuracy guarantee. [Results and scope](docs/validation.md).

![Independent mathematical accuracy test](docs/analytical_srs_dvh.png)

*Separate analytic validation: a known 6.5-mm³ sphere in a deliberately steep
dose field. The exact reference is mathematical. These curves do not stand in
for the actual benchmark's native-TPS comparison.*

```sh
python examples/analytical_benchmark.py --output-dir results/analytical
```

This example separates **volume sampling** from **input dose-grid sampling**.
It exports a figure and machine-readable results showing what can otherwise be
lost. All inputs are mathematical objects; no patient data or TPS access is needed.

`converge` requires **two consecutive refinements** to satisfy dose-metric,
volume and curve tolerances. The curve comparison uses the exact maximum
difference between the two empirical DVHs over **all observed dose thresholds**,
independent of plotting bins. Always inspect the returned evidence.

Numerical convergence applies to the supplied dose and geometry. It does not
prove that those inputs reproduce a TPS's internal surface or DVH volume.
No TPS is launched and no input DICOM is changed.

## For vendors and researchers

High-definition geometry support and adequate DVH evaluation belong together:
discarding the additional geometry during evaluation can remove its benefit.
Input dose resolution also matters. The [comparison protocol](docs/vendor_comparison.md)
separates geometry transfer, dose representation, numerical integration and
replanning. Use analytical tests before comparing real plan data.

Research software; clinical use requires separate commissioning and validation.
